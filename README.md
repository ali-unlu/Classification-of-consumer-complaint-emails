# Classification of consumer complaint emails

Here, I will use consumer complaints data from the Consumer Complaint Database {CFPB}<https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/>. The CFPB is an independent agency of the United States government that promotes transparency and protects consumers by providing information needed to make decisions when choosing financial institutions including banking institutions, lenders, mortgage services, credit unions, securities firms, foreclosure services, and debt collectors. One of the purposes of the agency is to receive and process complaints and questions about consumer financial products and services.   

When a complaint is submitted by a consumer, the CFPB has to determine which category the complaint falls in (e.g. "Mortgage", "Student loan", etc). In this project, I will build a classification algorithm to classify consumer complaints into one of four categories: "Credit card or prepaid card", "Mortgage", "Student loan", or "Vehicle loan or lease". Thus, Tte aimm of of this project is to predict the consumer complaint category.
